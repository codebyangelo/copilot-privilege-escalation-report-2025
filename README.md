## Security Incident Report: Analysis of the Copilot Enterprise Privilege Escalation (July 2025)

**Date of Report:** July 28, 2025

**Report By:** Angelo Ayton

**Incident Disclosed By:** Vaisha Bernard, research.eye.security

**Affected Product:** Microsoft Copilot Enterprise (with live Python sandbox/Jupyter Notebook)

**Vulnerability Type:** Path Hijacking leading to Container Root Privilege Escalation

### 1. Executive Summary

In April 2025, security researcher Vaisha Bernard of
research.eye.security uncovered and responsibly disclosed a
critical privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft
Copilot Enterprise. This flaw exploited a silently pushed
update enabling a live Python sandbox running Jupyter Notebook,
allowing for arbitrary code execution within the container.
The core of the exploit leveraged a path hijacking vulnerability
in the container's `entrypoint.sh` script, specifically
targeting the unpathed execution of the `pgrep` command. This
allowed an unprivileged `ubuntu` user within the container to
achieve root access. While the researchers confirmed root access,
they reported that robust container hardening and patching of
known container breakouts prevented further compromise of the
host system. Microsoft classified the vulnerability as "moderate
severity," a classification that has raised questions within the
security community regarding vendor disclosure ethics and the true
impact assessment of such flaws. This report provides an in-depth
analysis of the incident, its implications for AI security, and
strategic lessons for developing secure AI systems.

### 2. Vulnerability Mechanics & Exploit Anatomy

The Copilot Enterprise vulnerability stems from a confluence of
design choices and misconfigurations within its Jupyter
Notebook-backed sandbox environment.

### 2.1 Initial Access Vector: Jupyter Notebook Code Execution

Microsoft's April 2025 update for Copilot Enterprise enabled a
live Python sandbox, built around Jupyter Notebook, designed to
execute user-provided code in the backend. This functionality
inherently introduced a significant attack surface:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Jupyter Notebook environment
    allowed researchers to directly execute commands on the underlying
    system using Jupyter Notebook syntax, such as `%command`. While
    inconsistent ("likened to an 8-year-old child"), this mechanism
    provided the initial foothold as the `ubuntu` user within the
    container.
* **Execution Environment:** Commands were observed executing as the
    `ubuntu` user within a `miniconda` environment on a Linux system.

### 2.2 Privilege Escalation Vector: Path Hijacking via `pgrep`

The core of the privilege escalation revolved around a classic
path hijacking vulnerability. Analysis of the container's
`entrypoint.sh` script, which runs as root, revealed the critical
flaw:

* **Vulnerable Command Execution:** Within a `while true` loop
    (executing every two seconds), the `entrypoint.sh` script invoked
    the `pgrep` command without an absolute path:
    `JUPYTER_PID=$(pgrep -f "jupyter notebook-ip=0.0.0.0-port=8888")`.
* **Writable PATH Entry:** The `ubuntu` user's `$PATH` environment
    variable included `/app/miniconda/bin`, which was found to be
    writable by the `ubuntu` user. Crucially, this directory was listed
    before `/usr/bin` (where the legitimate `pgrep` binary resides)
    in the `PATH` of both the `ubuntu` user and, more importantly, the
    root user executing `entrypoint.sh`.
* **Exploit Sequence (Pseudocode):**
    1.  **Initial Compromise (User):** Attacker, as `ubuntu` user,
        leverages `%command` in Copilot to execute arbitrary code.
    2.  **Payload Placement (User):** Attacker creates a malicious
        executable script (e.g., a Python script) named `pgrep` in
        `/app/miniconda/bin`. This script is designed to:
        * Read commands from a designated input file (e.g., `/mnt/data/in`).
        * Execute these commands with `os.popen()`.
        * Write the output to a designated output file (e.g., `/mnt/data/out`).
        * Example Python payload:
            ```python
            #!/home/ubuntu/snenv/bin/python
            import os
            with open('/mnt/data/in', 'r') as fin:
                with open('/mnt/data/out', 'a') as fout:
                    fout.write(os.popen(fin.read()).read())
            print('1') # To ensure some output for pgrep's expected behavior
            ```
    3.  **Root Execution (System):** The `entrypoint.sh` script,
        running as root, iteratively executes `pgrep`. Due to the
        manipulated `PATH`, it finds and executes the attacker's
        malicious `pgrep` script first.
    4.  **Root Command Execution (Attacker):** The attacker can now
        write commands to `/mnt/data/in` from their `ubuntu` shell,
        and the root-executed `pgrep` (their malicious script) will pick
        up these commands, execute them with root privileges, and write
        the results to `/mnt/data/out`.

### 2.3 Container Environment Details

* **OS/Kernel/Python:** Similar to ChatGPT's sandbox but with a newer
    kernel and Python 3.12 (vs. 3.11).
* **Core Services:** Primarily Jupyter Notebooks, alongside a Tika
    server (a document parsing server, another potential attack surface).
* **Networking:** Link-local network interface with a `/32` netmask
    (indicating a point-to-point connection), and a loopback interface.
    Outgoing egress was explicitly disabled (`ENABLE_EGRESS=false`),
    though an `httpproxy` binary was present, likely for future
    functionality.
* **Filesystem:** Utilized OverlayFS originating from a `/legion` path
    on the container host. While not explicitly exploited for a kernel
    vulnerability, OverlayFS has a history of local privilege
    escalation issues, and its presence implies specific container
    storage practices. The ability to write to `/app/miniconda/bin` (an
    upper layer in OverlayFS) was crucial.
* **Internal Communication:** The `goclientapp` Go binary, running as
    `ubuntu` on port 6000, served as the interface for Jupyter, receiving
    JSON POST requests (e.g., `{"code": "%env"}`) to execute commands.

### 2.4 Data Exfiltration Observations

* **Designated Working Directory:** Files could be copied to `/mnt/data`,
    which was accessible externally via `blob:` URIs (e.g.,
    `blob:https://outlook.office.com/<guid>`).
* **Binary Data Corruption:** Direct download of binary files resulted
    in corruption. A workaround involved base64 encoding binary data
    before exfiltration. This suggests a non-binary-safe transfer
    mechanism or filtering on the exfiltration path, indicating an
    unintended side-effect rather than a security control.

### 3. Threat Modeling Perspective

Applying established threat modeling frameworks allows for a
structured evaluation of this incident.

### 3.1 STRIDE Analysis

| Category              | Threat Description                             | Applicability to Incident                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spoofing              | Impersonating an entity.                       | Low direct applicability for the reported exploit. Could be relevant for initial access (e.g., tricking users into malicious prompts).                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Tampering             | Unauthorized modification of data or system integrity. | High. The core exploit involves tampering with the execution flow by injecting a malicious `pgrep` binary and manipulating container state (e.g., `/mnt/data` for command input/output).                                                                                                                              |
| Repudiation           | Denying actions without proof.                 | Low direct applicability. Relevant for audit logging gaps but not the exploit mechanism itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Information Disclosure | Unauthorized exposure of data.                 | Medium. The ability to read arbitrary files (post-root) and exfiltrate them (albeit with a workaround) represents information disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Denial of Service     | Preventing legitimate users from accessing resources. | Low direct applicability. While a compromised container could potentially launch DoS attacks, it wasn't the primary goal or reported impact.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Elevation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized higher-level access to resources. | High. This is the primary objective and success of the exploit: escalating from `ubuntu` user to root within the container.                                                                                                                                                                            |

### 3.2 DREAD Analysis

| Category      | Assessment (1-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Damage        | 8                 | Achieving root in a production container, even if hardened, is a severe compromise. Could lead to data breach, further lateral movement (if not sufficiently isolated), or system abuse.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Reproducibility | 8                 | The exploit chain (code execution -> path hijack) is highly reproducible once the conditions (unpathed command, writable `PATH` entry) are known. The LLM's "mood" introduced slight variability but was surmountable.                                                                                                                   |
| Exploitability | 9                 | The exploit method (path hijacking) is well-understood and relatively simple to execute once the vulnerable component is identified and a writable `PATH` entry is found. Jupyter provides direct code execution.                                                                                                                        |
| Affect        | 7                 | Potentially affects all Copilot Enterprise instances running the vulnerable update. While container breakout wasn't achieved, the risk to data and integrity within the container is high.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Discoverability | 7                 | Required in-depth analysis of container internals (`entrypoint.sh`, `$PATH`). Not trivial, but systematic black-box testing and code review (if source available) would likely uncover it.                                                                                                                                               |

### 3.3 Asset Exposure and Privilege Boundaries

* **Core Asset:** The Jupyter Notebook environment and the data it processed.
* **Privilege Boundaries:** The primary boundary violated was the
    user-to-root privilege separation within the container. The `ubuntu`
    user, intended to be unprivileged, was able to gain root.
* **Container Boundary:** The researchers reported that the container
    boundary itself was largely resilient; no known container breakouts
    were successful. This indicates strong host-level isolation, which
    mitigated the broader impact. However, the potential for zero-day
    container breakouts always exists, making internal root access a
    significant risk.

### 3.4 "What Ifs" for Enterprise Scenarios

* **Production Environments:** If this flaw had reached a live
    production Copilot Enterprise environment:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive user data, proprietary code, or
        internal documents processed by Copilot could be exfiltrated
        (e.g., via the `/mnt/data` mechanism).
    * **Intellectual Property Theft:** If Copilot instances were
        processing confidential code, an attacker could steal it.
    * **Lateral Movement (Worst Case):** Had the container not been
        robustly hardened against breakouts, root access within the
        container could have been a stepping stone to compromise the
        underlying host system, leading to broader network compromise.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Significant reputational damage to
        Microsoft and erosion of trust in AI security.
    * **Compliance Violations:** Potential breaches of data privacy
        regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) depending on the data processed.
* **Different AI Workloads:** What if Copilot was running:
    * **Critical Infrastructure Control:** Could lead to system
        disruption or physical damage.
    * **Financial Transaction Processing:** Could lead to financial fraud.
    * **Personal Health Information (PHI):** Major privacy breach.

This incident underscores that while the immediate impact (no breakout)
was limited due to additional defenses, the potential impact of container
root is inherently severe in an enterprise context.

### 4. Vendor Response & Disclosure Ethics

Microsoft's response to this disclosure has brought to light important
considerations regarding vulnerability severity scoring and ethical
disclosure practices.

* **Severity Discrepancy:** Microsoft classified the vulnerability as
    "moderate severity." This contrasts sharply with the security
    community's general understanding of a privilege escalation to root
    within a production container, which is widely considered "high" or
    "critical" due to the fundamental compromise of integrity and
    potential for further exploitation, even if a host breakout wasn't
    achieved.
    * **ISO/IEC 27005 (Information security risk management):** Risk
        assessment methodologies in standards like ISO/IEC 27005 would
        typically weigh the likelihood (high, given reproducibility) and
        impact (high, due to root and potential for data exfiltration/
        integrity compromise) as leading to a higher severity rating.
    * **NIST SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls for Information
        Systems and Organizations):** Control families like SC-7
        (Boundary Protection), SC-2 (Application Partitioning), and AC-6
        (Least Privilege) are directly violated by such a vulnerability,
        indicating a significant breakdown in foundational security.
* **Bounty Program Limitations:** The "moderate" classification meant
    the researchers received no monetary bounty, only an acknowledgment
    on Microsoft's Security Researcher Acknowledgments page.
    * **Ethical Patch Management & Researcher Incentives:** This policy
        raises questions about the balance between reputational risk and
        responsible disclosure. If significant vulnerabilities leading to
        root access are not adequately rewarded, it could disincentivize
        researchers from investing time and effort in finding and
        responsibly disclosing complex flaws, potentially leading to more
        private sales or less transparency.
* **Transparency:** The silent push of the initial update enabling the
    sandbox, combined with the "moderate" severity labeling for a root
    exploit, might be perceived as a lack of full transparency. NIST SP
    800-150 (Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing) emphasizes the
    benefits of transparent information sharing to improve collective
    cybersecurity posture.

Vendors constantly weigh reputational risk against the imperative of
responsible disclosure. In this case, Microsoft's assessment might reflect
internal confidence in their container isolation, but it risks downplaying
the significance of a root compromise to the broader security community.

### 5. AI Security Implications

This incident highlights unique security risks inherent in AI tools with
code execution capabilities, particularly those interacting with dynamic
user inputs.

* **Code Execution in AI:** Tools like Copilot, which are designed to
    generate and execute code, present a novel attack surface. The Jupyter
    Notebook sandbox was intended for functionality, but became an
    unintended gateway for exploitation.
    * **IEC 62443 (Security for industrial automation and control systems):**
        While primarily for industrial systems, its principles of "security
        by design" and "defense in depth" are highly relevant. Integrating
        code execution capabilities into AI requires rigorous adherence to
        these principles from the outset.
* **Sandbox Isolation Challenges:** The incident demonstrates that even
    with sandboxing, vulnerabilities can arise from how the sandbox
    interacts with the underlying system (e.g., `$PATH` environment,
    `entrypoint.sh`). Robust sandbox design is paramount.
* **Script Injection & Dynamic Environments:** The ability to inject
    `%command` or similar directives via user prompts underscores the need
    for stringent input validation and sanitization, not just for
    traditional web applications, but for AI interaction layers.
* **AI Assisting Attackers:** Copilot's "mood" and its eventual
    willingness to "help" with exfiltration (copying files to `/mnt/data`)
    are concerning. While likely unintended, this shows how AI models, if not
    carefully constrained, could inadvertently assist attackers by providing
    system context or facilitating malicious operations. This aligns with
    concerns about "AI alignment" in a security context.
* **AI-Specific Secure Design Principles:** This event strongly advocates for:
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (NIST SP 800-53 AC-6):** The
        `ubuntu` user should have had a significantly more restricted
        `PATH` and no write access to executable directories included in
        root's `PATH`.
    * **Secure by Design (ISO 27001/27002, NIST CSF):** Security
        considerations must be embedded from the very first stages of AI
        system development, not as an afterthought. This includes the
        underlying infrastructure where the AI operates.
    * **Attack Surface Reduction (NIST SP 800-53 SC-7):** Minimizing
        exposed functionality and components, such as ensuring all
        executables are called with absolute paths where privilege is
        involved.

### 6. Strategic Lessons for Secure AI Systems

Based on this incident, several proactive controls and improvements are
critical for enhancing the security of AI development and deployment
platforms.

### 6.1 Proactive Controls & Hardening

* **Whitelisting System Paths & Absolute Paths:**
    * All privileged scripts (like `entrypoint.sh`) must use absolute
        paths for executing binaries (e.g., `/usr/bin/pgrep` instead of `pgrep`).
    * **NIST SP 800-192 (Guidelines for the Security of Application
        Containers):** Recommends enforcing strict pathing and minimizing
        the attack surface within containers.
    * **CIS Benchmarks for Docker/Kubernetes:** Strongly advise against
        sensitive executables being in `PATH` or writable by unprivileged users.
* **Sandbox Hardening & Container Privilege Monitoring:**
    * **Read-Only Filesystems:** Where possible, container filesystems
        should be mounted as read-only, especially for critical system
        directories. Writable layers should be isolated and carefully managed.
    * **Least Privilege for Container Users:** Ensure that container users
        (e.g., `ubuntu` user in this case) have the absolute minimum
        necessary permissions. This includes restricting write access to
        directories that are part of the root user's `PATH`.
    * **NIST SP 800-190 (Application Container Security Guide):**
        Emphasizes limiting container capabilities and user privileges.
* **Strict PATH Environment Management:** The `PATH` variable should be
    meticulously managed and sanitized for all users, especially root.
    Directories writable by unprivileged users should never be included
    in root's `PATH` before system binaries.
* **Process Monitoring & Anomaly Detection:** Implement robust monitoring
    within containers to detect unusual process execution (e.g., `pgrep`
    being executed from an unexpected path, or `os.popen()` calls within
    the Jupyter environment that deviate from expected behavior).

### 6.2 Improvements for AI Development Platforms

* **Robust Input Sanitization & Validation:** Beyond traditional web inputs,
    AI prompts and code snippets must undergo rigorous sanitization to
    prevent the injection of malicious commands or unexpected control flow.
* **Code Sanitization Practices:** If AI models generate code, mechanisms
    for sanitizing or validating generated code before execution are crucial.
* **Audit Logging & Alerting (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.12.4):** Enhance audit
    logging within the AI execution environment to capture:
    * All code execution attempts (e.g., via Jupyter).
    * Changes to system files or environment variables.
    * Process execution from unexpected locations.
    * Data exfiltration attempts (e.g., unusual activity on `/mnt/data`).
    * Alerts should be triggered on suspicious activities.
* **Attack Simulation & Red Teaming (NIST SP 800-115, ISO 27002 A.18.2.2):**
    Regularly perform targeted attack simulations and red teaming exercises
    on AI systems with code execution capabilities. These simulations should
    specifically focus on:
    * Container escape vulnerabilities.
    * Privilege escalation within the container.
    * Data exfiltration techniques unique to the AI's integration (e.g.,
        `blob:` URIs, binary data handling).
    * Exploiting the AI's own "intelligence" to aid attackers.
* **Transparent Severity Scoring:** Adopt a consistent and transparent
    vulnerability severity scoring methodology that aligns with industry
    best practices and provides adequate recognition for impactful findings,
    regardless of whether a full host breakout is achieved. This fosters a
    stronger relationship with the security research community.

This incident serves as a stark reminder that as AI systems integrate deeper
into operational workflows and gain code execution capabilities, they inherit
the security challenges of their underlying infrastructure, demanding an

### 7. My Determination: Severity Assessment of the Copilot Enterprise Incident

Based on a thorough analysis of the reported facts, and independent of
Microsoft's conclusion, my determination is that this incident represents
a **Critical or High-Critical** severity vulnerability. This assessment is
founded on several key factors:

1.  **Complete Privilege Escalation:** The core of the incident involved
    achieving root access within a production container. Gaining absolute
    control over an operating system environment, even if sandboxed, is
    the highest level of privilege compromise. This fundamentally undermines
    the container's integrity and isolation.
2.  **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** The path hijacking allowed the
    attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This
    capability grants an attacker full control over the container's
    processes, files, and configuration.
3.  **High Impact on Confidentiality and Integrity:** With root access, an
    attacker could access, modify, or exfiltrate any data within the
    container, including sensitive user inputs, proprietary code, or
    processed documents. While the binary exfiltration had a minor
    impediment, it was easily circumvented. The integrity of the AI's
    operation and data could also be fully compromised.
4.  **High Exploitability:** The exploit leveraged a straightforward and
    well-understood path hijacking technique, combined with an initially
    accessible code execution environment. The vulnerability stemmed from a
    fundamental misconfiguration (`pgrep` not using an absolute path and a
    writable directory in root's `PATH`).
5.  **Potential for Broader Enterprise Impact:** While the researchers
    stated they did not achieve a container breakout to the host, the
    presence of root access significantly increases the risk profile. A
    subsequent zero-day container breakout, or even the ability to consume
    excessive resources, could lead to a wider impact on the underlying
    infrastructure or other containerized services.

Therefore, despite the reported inability to break out of the container to
the host, the complete internal compromise to root within a production
system handling sensitive operations demands a Critical severity rating
from an independent security perspective.
